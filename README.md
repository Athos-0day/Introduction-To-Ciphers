# Introduction to ciphers
---

In this repository, I share my work on the book **Breaking codes with python**. This is not my first time on python, but I chose this book to learn the basics of ciphers and learn how to make a plan to break a number. There is also the historical side that interests me.

Python is the best programming language for working on ciphers and cryptographic algorithms. Python's high-level data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples, are great for handling cryptographic data like keys, nonces, and ciphertext. 

For Each cipher, we will work on a user interface and the goal is to hack a file which is encrypted, or just decrypted or encrypted a file with the key.
