On an exceptionally hot evening early in July, a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. Bridge.

He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house, and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady, who was a widow, had a small but pretty flat in the same building, and the young man, having for some time been in her debt for rent, was now trying to avoid the confrontation that would surely arise if they met.

He had a letter to deliver and was unsure about whether to go to his mother's house or not. This uncertainty, along with his increasing sense of despair and agitation, had led him to linger in the street outside the building, as if trying to gather enough strength to take the next step.

The young man’s name was Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. He was a former student, and although he had been poor for some time, he was still trying to finish his studies. His appearance was untidy, and his clothes were worn. His eyes were dark and sharp, and there was a look of suppressed tension about him, as if something was weighing heavily on his mind.

As he reached the bridge, he stood still for a moment, gazing into the darkening waters below. The evening was stifling hot, and the heat, combined with his dismal mood, made him feel as though he was on the verge of something dire.

He thought about his situation. His funds had run out, his education seemed impossible to finish, and his future seemed uncertain at best. His pride, however, was stronger than any feeling of despair. He could not bring himself to seek help from his friends or family, and he loathed the idea of being pitied.

As he turned to leave the bridge and continue his walk through the darkening streets, his mind was occupied by an idea—an idea that would come to haunt him and shape the events of his life in the coming weeks.
