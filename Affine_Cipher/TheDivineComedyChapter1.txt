Canto I: The Dark Forest

Midway upon the journey of our life,
I found myself within a dark wood,
For the straightforward path had been lost.

Ah, how hard it is to tell
What it was like, this wood of wilderness,
Savage and stubborn (the thought of it renews my fear)!

It is so bitter that death could scarce be bitterer.
But if I would show the good that came of it
I must talk about things other than the good.

How I got there I cannot really tell,
I was so full of sleep just at the point
Where I abandoned the true way.
